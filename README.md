# School APP
*I call this a school app and the idea is for kids at a daycare center can themselves fob in front of a camera and it 
will automatically send their picture or video to their parents as a way to let the parents know that their kids are ok.*
*You can link the fob id with the contact information*
## The tech
I am using python flask as the back end. SQLite for the database. OpenCV for controlling the multimedia. Twilio for sending
pictures and video via text message. A simple python script for sending email with gmail and Bcrypt for encrypting your password.
For the front end: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, FontAwesome, Javascript, JQuery.
#### Info?
*If interested in running this app and have any questions: dogrock2lnx@gmail.com*
You will need a gmail account, a twilio account, your email password will need to go in an environment variable.
For hardware you will need a camera and a specific type of RFID card reader with some key fobs. A simple UI will make the 
setup easy. Default password is password. Enjoy!
