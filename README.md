# School APP
*I call this a school app and the idea is for kids at a daycare center can themselves fob in front of a camera and it 
will automatically send their picture or video to their parents as a way to let the parents know that their kids are ok.*
## The tech
I am using python flask as the back end. SQLite for the database. OpenCV for controling the multimedia. Twilio for sending
pictures and video via text message. A simple python script for sending email via gmail. For the front end: HTML, CSS, 
Bootstrap, Font awesome, Javascript, JQuery.
